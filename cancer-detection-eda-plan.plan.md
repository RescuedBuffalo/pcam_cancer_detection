# Histopathologic Cancer Detection - EDA & Modeling Plan

## 1. Problem Description & Data Overview (Step 1 - 5 pts)

Document in notebook:

- Competition objective: Binary classification of 96×96 RGB pathology image patches
- Dataset size: 262K training, 32K validation, 32K test samples
- Data format: HDF5 files for images, CSV for metadata
- Challenge: Identify metastatic cancer tissue in histopathology images

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Step 2 - 15 pts)

### 2.1 Class Distribution Analysis

- Calculate class balance (tumor vs normal) in train/validation sets
- Visualize distribution with bar charts
- Check for class imbalance issues

### 2.2 Image Visualization

- Display sample images from both classes (tumor/normal)
- Create grid of random samples showing variety
- Visualize difficult/edge cases if identifiable

### 2.3 Statistical Analysis

- Pixel intensity distributions across RGB channels
- Mean/std statistics per class
- Correlation between metadata fields (center_tumor_patch vs tumor_patch)

### 2.4 Data Quality Checks (ENHANCED)

**Comprehensive quality validation to ensure data integrity:**

1. **Missing Values Check**: Verify no missing data in metadata or images
2. **Dimensional Consistency**: Confirm all images are 96×96×3 RGB
3. **Pixel Value Range**: Check min/max values are within expected bounds
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identify images with extreme mean intensities
5. **Label-Metadata Consistency**: Verify labels match metadata tumor_patch field
6. **Low Variance Detection**: Find potentially blank or featureless images
7. **Pixel Saturation**: Check for over/under-exposed images
8. **Train/Validation Distribution**: Statistical comparison (KS test)
9. **Duplicate Detection**: Sample-based check for duplicate images

### 2.5 Data Characteristics Analysis

- Distribution of patches per WSI (whole slide image)
- Spatial distribution analysis using coordinates
- Color/staining variation analysis across different source slides

### 2.6 Center Region Analysis (NEW - Architecture Insight)

**Purpose**: Understand if tumor cells are concentrated in center regions to inform architecture design

- Compare center vs periphery pixel intensities
- Analyze correlation with 'center_tumor_patch' metadata field
- Visualize center region on sample images
- **Impact on Architecture**:
  - Inform use of attention mechanisms
  - Guide center-weighted loss functions
  - Determine optimal receptive field sizes

### 2.7 Data Augmentation Preview (NEW - Training Strategy Insight)

**Purpose**: Test and visualize augmentation strategies before training

- Preview rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness augmentations
- Test combined augmentation pipeline
- Verify augmentations preserve diagnostic features
- Compare effects on tumor vs normal samples
- **Impact on Training**:
  - Validate augmentation parameters
  - Ensure no unrealistic artifacts
  - Inform augmentation aggressiveness level

**EDA Insights to Inform Architecture**:

- Class balance → perfectly balanced, no special handling needed
- Image complexity → transfer learning recommended
- Color variation → strong augmentation needed
- Dataset size → sufficient for fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Center region importance → consider attention mechanisms
- Augmentation robustness → aggressive augmentation preserves features

## 3. Model Architecture (Step 3 - 25 pts)

### 3.1 Baseline Models

- Simple CNN (3-4 conv layers) as baseline
- Pre-trained models: ResNet18/34, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV2
- **VLM Zero-Shot Baseline**: CLIP or BiomedCLIP for zero-shot classification

### 3.2 LLM/VLM Integration (Novel Approach)

**Vision-Language Model Baseline**:

- Use CLIP or BiomedCLIP for zero-shot classification
- Create text prompts: "histopathology image with metastatic cancer" vs "normal healthy tissue"
- Compare cosine similarity between image and text embeddings
- No training required - leverages pre-trained medical/general knowledge

**Ensemble Approach**:

- Combine predictions from best CNN model(s) with VLM predictions
- Weighted average or simple voting mechanism
- Compare individual model vs ensemble performance

### 3.3 Architecture Rationale

- Transfer learning justified by: medical image similarity to natural images, limited training time
- Fine-tuning strategy: freeze early layers, train classifier + late layers
- VLM approach: leverages language-vision alignment and potential domain knowledge
- Ensemble: combines traditional deep learning with modern multi-modal models
- Compare architectures based on: parameter count, inference speed, validation performance

### 3.4 Data Preprocessing

- Normalization using ImageNet statistics (for transfer learning)
- CLIP-specific preprocessing for VLM models
- Data augmentation: rotation, flipping, color jittering, slight zoom
- Handle class imbalance with weighted loss or oversampling

## 4. Training & Hyperparameter Tuning (Step 4 - 35 pts)

### 4.1 Experiments to Run

- Learning rate search (1e-5 to 1e-2)
- Batch size optimization (16, 32, 64)
- Optimizer comparison (Adam, SGD with momentum)
- Augmentation ablation study
- Different pre-trained architectures
- Fine-tuning depth (how many layers to unfreeze)

### 4.2 Performance Metrics

- AUC-ROC (primary Kaggle metric)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Per-WSI performance analysis

### 4.3 Training Techniques

- Early stopping with patience
- Learning rate scheduling (reduce on plateau)
- Model checkpointing (save best validation AUC)
- K-fold cross-validation if time permits

### 4.4 Analysis

- Training curves (loss and accuracy)
- Compare architectures in results table
- Document what worked and what didn't
- Error analysis on misclassified samples

## 5. Conclusion (Step 5 - 15 pts)

- Summarize best performing model and metrics
- Key learnings: what improved performance most
- Failed experiments and why
- Future improvements: ensemble methods, attention mechanisms, external data

## 6. Deliverables (Step 6 - 35 pts)

- Kaggle submission and leaderboard screenshot
- Requirements.txt for reproducibility
